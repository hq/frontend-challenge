# HQ Frontend Challenge

HQ Frontend take home challenge

## Requirements

HQ will provide you with a design mockup file, and we'll need you to build those as close as possible.

## How to work on this challenge

1.  Create a public repository.
2.  Work locally.
3.  Push your changes to your public repository.
4.  Deploy your changes to your favorite hosting solution.
5.  Share your public repository and preview link.

## We'll evaluate the following:

- Semantic HTML
- Code as close as possible to pixel perfect
- We'll run your code into PageSpeed.
- How clean and organized your code is

### Notes

- You can choose any technology stack to implement this assignment. We will consider exclusively the quality of your project (technology and product-wise) to evaluate your work.
- You can use Google Fonts.
- We are not expecting to get a 100 on the PageSpeed score. However, we do expect some considerations to get at least a 50.
- We expect some essential documentation if your code can be run locally.
